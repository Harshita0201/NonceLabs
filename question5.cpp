// Ques 5: There are pillars near the road. The distance between the pillars is the same and the width of the pillars is the same. Your function accepts three arguments:


// number of pillars (â‰¥ 1);

// distance between pillars (10 - 30 meters);

// width of the pillar (10 - 50 centimeters).

// Calculate the distance between the first and the last pillar in centimeters (without the width of the first and last pillar)

long pillars(int n, int d, int w) {  
  d *= 100;   
  return n > 1 ? (n - 2) * w + (n - 1) * d : 0; 
}
